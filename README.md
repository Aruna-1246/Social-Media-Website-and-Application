3. **Scope of Development Project**

This document covers the functional and non-functional requirements of the social media website, including user profiles, posting features, messaging, security, and scalability. It is especially useful for the entertainment where modifications in the content can be done easily according to requirements.

The project can be easily implemented under various situations. We can add new features as and when we require, making reusability possible as there is flexibility in all the modules. The language used for developing the project is Java as it is quite advantageous than other languages in terms of performance, tools available, cross platform compatibility, libraries, cost (freely available), and development process.
